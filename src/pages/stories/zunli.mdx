description: In Zunli 245, the Yin dynasty came to an end. It had presided over the Ancient Empire for just over one millennia, yet due to famine and disaster, the rule of Yin finally shattered. Today, the Empire is cleaved in four, with two Emperors and two Kings, all in uneasy stalemate.

### Translation 

In the Year Zunli 213, the Zunli Emperor of the Yin dynasty caught illness, and passed. His wife, Tsai Jiaoyin (given name Airos), took the throne as regent. The Empress dowager ruled her country for a full 32 years. Though she was kind, she could not rule the realm well. In Zunli 245, the people suffered a great famine, which caused the people to rise in revolt against her rule. In the ensuing battle, many dragonkind were slain by the rebels. They overran the Capital, captured the Empress dowager, tortured, and executed her. Such an unforgivable transgression, caused uproar within the dragon-lords.


In Zunli 247, historials place the death of the dynasty of Yin, and the realm fell into civil war for many years.

The Empress dowager's cousin, Jang Yujing of the Four Gorges Jang clan (given name Hakaeron), proclaimed himself as the first emperor of a new dynasty, with his given name as Syin-dai, to be the rightful successor to the Yin.

The many dragon-lords of the empire bowed to Jang, and joined his side. The rebels gathered around a General Wu, Count Wu of Shang, given name Chang-an.

In the ensuing battles, the Jang were pushed back, and retreated westwards, fleeing to the western mountains of Damak (Taichuan), under the rule of House Ma.

Lord Ma welcomed the Jang company, and also proclaimed him as the rightful emperor, and the Jang as the rightful successor to the Yin in the lineage of the empire.

Thus, Emperor Jang made the city of Chiao, in Damak, his capital, whilst General Wu made the city of Chang-guan his capital, proclaiming the Dynasty of Shang, and himself its founding emperor: Jian-yi.

Today, Damak, the Western Realms, and Cloudshearth (Taichuan, Syi-yu, Yun-syin) are ruled by the Jang. Nanyun, and the Jin peninsula, broke away and are their own countries, and the rest of the realm is ruled by the Dynasty of Shang.

Syin-dai still today sits on the throne, whilst the Shang have passed through five generations, with with Wu Yi-syian now ruling the realm, as the Emperor Dzu-lung.
