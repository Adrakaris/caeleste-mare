### 三龍萬軍
<Large>
長戰時代，靈之孔氏爲上，天下西山太川之主，馬氏也。 馬氏萬年治其郡，中原諸國無可奈之何矣。中國亂，盧 藏之王曰：中原無大皇可援馬國，朕大藏之威必在其 上矣。欲戰太川爲己，遂師萬兵而東侵。踰天地泉多日， 王未遇馬軍，無抗深入川。其軍入六百里在岟山之 頂寨。翌日王見對有三騎者，標馬徽。王發其探，午歸而 奉信曰：馬主迎藏王拜鄙國，然求大王今退之，退則朕 諒此征，不則將令朕三騎滅君兵，無不殺矣。藏王哂之 曰：僅三人豈可滅朕軍矣哉，朕性好，若彼三小人明日 之前去，朕饒其命矣，不去則擒、刑而殺。三騎未去，果藏 王令其軍擒而殺之，軍至騎者突化龍，以聖寒火滅盡 藏兵，一人無饒，逐藏獲勝。因今人嘗云：三龍萬軍。

### Translation 

In the time of the Long Conflict, when the Elven House of Kung was dominant, the Lords of the western mountains and the Damak vale (Taichuan) were the House of Ma. The House of Ma had for millennia ruled his commandery, and none in the many kindoms of the central plains could defeat him.

The central kingdoms were in disarray, and the King of Luzan said "There is no Emperor in the plains that can save the Kingdom of Ma, they alone are no match for the might of my great Luzan!"

He wanted to conquer the Damak valley and rule over it as his own, so raised an army of ten thousand men, and marched east. Crossing the Spring of the Earth, and over the coming days, he did not meet any Ma army, and without resistance marched deep into the valley.

600 li into Damak, his army encamped on top of Yang mountain. The next day, the King saw that across on the opposing mountain were three cavalrymen, bearing the insignia of House Ma. The King sent his scouts out to them, and by noon they returned, carrying a letter from Lord Ma, which said:

"Lord Ma welcomes Your Grace to his humble realm, but begs him to retreat at greatest haste. If Your Grace retreats his armies, then I will forgive this incursion. Else, I will command my three cavalrymen to destroy your army, with not one person left alive."

The King of Luzan derided this, saying "How can only three cavalrymen hope to defeat my army!? I'm in a good mood, if those three small men would leave before the next morn, I will spare their lives. If they do not leave, them you are to capture, torture, and execute them."

The next morn, the three cavalrymen did not leave, and thus the King sent his soldiers to capture and kill them. As his army arrived, the men suddenly turned into dragons, and with their frost-flame breath, slaughtered the Luzanese soldiers, with not one being spared, and expelled the Luzanese from Damak.

Henceforth now, it is commonly said that: "Three dragons are an army".

### Context

The idiom 「三龍萬軍 / _sen rekhar laikon_ / three dragons are an army」 has the meaning of never underestimate your enemy, or never underestimate some seemingly innocent task, especially under suspicious circumstances. It was the King of Luzan that underestimated the "three cavalrymen" of Ma, unaware that they would be revealed as three dragons in disguise (the sons of Lord Ma, not included in extract), and that as members of a powerful and ancient dragon clan they fully had the capability to decisively defeat whatever the Luzanese could muster at the time.

The **"central states"**, referred to as 中國, is the oft-used term for all small kingdoms which made up the shattered Ancient Empire. When united, fully or effectively (like the modern Shaag dynasty) the Ancient Empire is referred to as simply the name of that dynasty, as 大商. However, more general terms are also used, such as 古代帝國, _Ancient Empire_, 暥國 _Kingdom of Asyr_, or simply 天下 _under heaven_ (note: 暥 is a standin for a non-unicode character, made of radicals 日+帝, pronounced the same).

The **Ma Clan** is one of the oldest continuous family dynasties in the Ancient Empire, having pretty much always ruled the Vale of Damak to the west. They generally maintain an attitude of non-intervention in times of conflict, and are sufficiently well defended on all sides to maintain that.

**Luzan** is a mountainous kingdom to the west, deep in the mountains, centred around a large plateau. They have a very militaristic and stratified culture, and have been known in the past to incur into Damak and surrounding regions, sometimes controlling over half of the fertile river valleys when the Ma and other western clans are at their weakest.
