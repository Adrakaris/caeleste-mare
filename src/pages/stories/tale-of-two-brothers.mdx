# The Tale of Two Brothers
</ColourBand>

<CBox>
<Drop>A</Drop>n epic from the far-flung land of Aseron, about two dragon gods of rain, their rise and clash with Asyr Shai. These gods are said to control the rains and make the land habitable and temperate. However, since they are separated, their powers are weaker, and that is why droughts and storms still occasionally scour the land.

*new for 2024*: Updated in the fourth iteration of eastern rekharhakr draconic, now with more irregular verbs.

Of grey sun-scorched earth, / _zon dir asiir yiríns_  
And of Xiron's grace, / _A zon xirónon krars_  
Born from mortal hearth, / _zon esxín siak_  
Of the draconic race. / _a zon idíks rekhár_

Two brothers were born, / _Ahr yelvór genís,_  
In great mountains deep, / _Ith hákros vath,_  
Eyes of burning dawn, / _Arúm san asái yirín,_  
Scales of azure sea. / _Zaakos san thur xasáth._

On the sun-scorched earth, / _Zon dir asiir yiríns,_  
The flood-rains came fast, / _Miirvúthos xyae komás,_  
Bringing with them death, / _Nal thiaa komás khars,_  
And famine as they passed. / _A líkhres tao yiríns._

People starved, people died, / _Árik likháins, árik kharatíns,_  
In this chaotic world, / _Ith hir kanai diskáie,_  
The twins watched their plight, / _Yelr nadéns thiaaron kastái,_  
The chaos they try withstand. / _diskáia thiaa ankoníns._

But from Xiron’s grace, / _Ir zon xirónon krars,_  
Rose divinity of Gods, / _Gaimíns xána taníe,_  
Magic interlaced, / _Makára sinyarvíns,_  
Within the brothers’ blood. / _Yelvóron arkhái ithiin._

They watched in distress, / _Yelr nal vriae nadéns,_  
As chaos awashed the land, / _Kai diskáia dir thíravins,_  
And with magic they possessed, / _A nal makára saa ayaan,_  
To guard them, they planned. / _kantii thiaa, saa laevíns._

They raised heads and roared, / _saa matáins tokái, vrakháie_  
A command to the sky, / _Tarxaal tao sára,_  
To the rains that lashed and poured, / _Tao miirvúthos evakháie,_  
To fall gently from high. / _Sii áriae, a erváie._

And the people rejoiced, / _A árik karomíns,_  
Blessed with gentle rains, / _Vuthós erváie kamaas,_  
But the prayers they voiced, / _Ir gáda thiaa gardíns,_  
Met another’s disdain. / _Alaaron aráks saeraas._

The wrath of Asyr Shai, / _Asiiron khimér kharáse,_  
Was terror to behold, / _San diziiren vaivére,_  
All shall quake in fear, / _Enád has xir’rakhiin,_  
Afore the Empress of Gold! / _Dimúr tan-rekhán kínae!_

How dare they half blood, / _Khak tamiin yamarkhái,_  
How dare they half divine, / _Khak tamiin tae'erxána,_  
Taint the world with mud, / _Diathiin kháron kanái,_  
Scorn that of her design? / _Parakín kháron xáeda?_

But torment cannot come, / _Ir tao saa, takhaal dkhomás,_  
To those divine within, / _Tao saa, saa xána ayaar,_  
Though in her eyes scum, / _Akái tao khar daet siin,_  
They were still of kin. / _Saa is atáne kath._

So another sentence dealt, / _Alaar timorík si maizíns,_  
To be torn asunder, / _Si skazíns khiyáris,_  
In Damak Dai, one dwelt, / _Ith damak dai yir aranín,_  
One exiled far yonder. / _Yir áeksirin mákris_

So a balance rose, / _Ithár iséryi gaimíns,_  
Between the earth and sky, / _Ithárer dir a sara,_  
Where rains gave repose, / _Ton vuthos yaan malán,_  
From the chaos of Shai. / _Zon xáion diskáia._
