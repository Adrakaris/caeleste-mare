# Genesis
</ColourBand>

<CBox>
Lacking a writing system for a very long time, the draconic culture is oft preserved in oral tradition, passed down from father to son, from mother to daughter. Though they have long since diverged into two major culture groups, both east and west still remember the epics of ancient days, recited in an ancient tongue now long disused.

Historians speculate that the origins of this Genesis poem was west of the Spring of the Lake, in arid mountains between the lands of the Luzan and Parsor. It has then spread in both directions, being known in some variation or another by all in the old world.

Draconic script is included. Traditionally, draconic was always written in majuscule form, and it is theorised that originally the script did not mark short vowels. However, all vowls are since marked, and long vowels are marked with double letters. In classic style, punctuation is usually omitted.

### One: The Past | _iir, pras_

In ancient days, / _i sar xínae,_  
In those ancient days, / _i hir sar xínae,_  
In starless nights, / _i xaar i’áida_  
Ancient starless nights. / _xaar i’áida xínae._

A time when heaven separated from earth, / _khro sar salk’ns zo dir,_  
A time when earth separated from heaven, / _khro dir salk’ns zo sar,_  
A time when the first waters flowed, / _khro th’r iir ulsns,_  
And the first grains sprang from the earth. / _a tára iir órin._

The sun shone then, / _tir, asiir sers,_  
In the starless black sky, / _i sar rord i’áida,_  
The sun shone then, / _tir, asiir sers,_  
Over the ancient land. / _riia dir xínae._

He, the great, walked, / _thaa, táni, diisns,_  
Across the ancient land, / _sua dir xínae,_  
She, the mighty, flew, / _khaa, álsi, (a)sráins,_  
Through the starless sky. / _sua sar i’áida._

### Two: The Creation | _ah, genín_

In ancient days, / _i sar xínae,_  
Where none walked but he, / _ton ir thaa, rin diisns,_  
In starless nights, / _i xaar i’áida,_  
Where none flew but she. / _ton ir khaa, rin (a)sráins._

A time when the land was yet barren, / _khro dir (a)tán taikh,_  
A time when heaven was yet young, / _khro sar (a)tán zál(i),_  
A time when there was naught but seas, / _khro tak rin, ir th’r,_  
And mountains, plains, forests. / _a haks, fiiris, kah(a)l._

When the world was young, / _as kánai zál(i)._  
And none roamed the land / _rin diisns dir,_  
He gave life to the beasts, / _thaa malns diiz(i) xin,_  
And birds, and fish. / _a úhar, a r’gar._

When the world was young, / _as kánai zál(i),_  
And the heavens were empty, / _a sar yár(i),_  
She gave birth to the first dragons, / _khaa geníns iir rekhár,_  
Dragons to rule the sky. / _rekhár (a)skhákn sar’i._

### Three: The Rest | _sen, r'kmin_

In ancient days, / _i sar xínae,_  
Where all was bountiful, / _as (e)nád genái,_  
Where we, the dragons ruled, / _as ur, rekhár (a)skhákns,_  
Over all birds and beasts. / _riia (e)nád diiz(i), uhár._

The world of Asyr’s creation, / _kánai asiiron genín,_  
The world of Xiron’s care, / _kánai xirónon t’vix,_  
Asyr, chaotic, like fire, / _asiir, d’skor, san yir,_  
Xiron, steadfast, like ice. / _xíron, zatái, san thaks._

In ancient days, / _i sar xínae_  
In those ancient days, / _i hir sar xínae_  
As the world grew a little older, / _en kánai kaln ál(i),_  
As the Gods flew a little further, / _en xána (a)sráins ál(i),_

He, the great, made / _thaa, táni, geníns,_  
Stars from diamond, / _i’ái zon xír(o)n,_  
She, the mighty, became / _khaa, álsi, siins,_  
The Sun and Moon. / _ásiir a x’ai._

### IV: The Future | _xirn, dar_

In ancient days, / _i sar xínae,_  
They danced their dance, / _kad korns kadon korn,_  
Through the great heavens above, / _sua sar táni riia,_  
Around the glittering stars. / _yur i’ái s’rai._

From ancient days, / _zo sar xínae,_  
We danced our dance, / _ur korns uron korn,_  
Through plains and mountains, / _sua haks a fiiris,_  
Through skies and seas. / _sua sar a th’r,_

We carry Asyr’s blood, / _ur virln asiiron xin,_  
We carry Xiron’s armour, / _ur virln xirónon khyakh,_  
Lords of land and sea, / _arkhán tou dir a th’r,_  
And the star-filled sky. / _a sar i’ái híra._

You are a child of Asyr, / _zah asiiron xior,_  
You are a child of Xiron, / _zah xirónon xior,_  
Child, you are fire, / _xior, zah siin yir,_  
Child, you rule the skies. / _xior, zah (a)skhákn sar._
