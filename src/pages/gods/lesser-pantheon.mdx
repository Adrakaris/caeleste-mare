### Golmak, the Fallen One
【中】死神、墮落之神、牧靈者

Once, Golmak was a respected old god, the God of Death and one who guides departed souls. Yet he was never satisfied with the souls of mortals; his greed seeking greater and greater power. Then, he tried to take a soul more powerful than any in existence; the soul of another old god. Golmak attacked Chara, trying to claim her soul and usurp her place, and his armies of the dead risen from the void itself invaded the other planes, resulting in a war that turned all the gods on him, ripped apart the old material plane, saw the death of Asyr's greatest general, and finally lead to his downfall.

From a broken piece of the material world Chara and Kleios fashioned the deep dark, and sealed his shattered body within it, to forever live in the shadows in torture and pain. 

However, wisps of his soul did escape the calamity, corrpting those from mere mortals to even the great Jin Jou himself, keeping the idea of the God of Death alive amongst the masses.

*Fear where the light does not glow.*

### Aligheri, King of Mors

【中】閻王

Aligheri was once a human, the most wretched and corrupt of his race. His cruelty and barbarism landed him in the deepest, darkest part of the City of Mors, in its heart, but even still the torment did not affect him. He reveled in the torture and pain, and through the magic of this realm his joy was turned upon him and corrupted him, until he was no longer a man but a fiend, a fiend more frightening and unhallow than any that preceeded him. 

The gods named him king of the flaming city, though he is a king trapped in his own kingdom, with those deserving of the severest punishment being sent to his domain for the King to toy with.

### The Seven Gods of Man

【中】人族七神

The Seven Gods of Man, also called the Seven Judges, are the first seven children of Estia. They lead the Heavenly Council, that judges the dead, regulates the lesser gods, and acts as a mediator of heavenly dispute. Once, they were seven kings in the mortal realm, ruling with virtue for millennia.

"The fairest Heaven is an unfeeling Heaven" is their iron principle, and an unfeeling heaven is what they maintain. They do not interfere with the mortal plane, and make action through inaction. However, dark wisps lurk just under the surface; just as how a human is most fleeting, most changeable, most corruptible, the Seven reflect that part of humanity within them, and though their reign remains stable, who knows how long that may last?

Though the Seven have names, they are unknown, and worshippers of the Seven Gods simply refer to them as "The Seven".

### The White Prophet

【中】純白聖人

The White Prophet was a human man who lived many thousands of years ago, in the ancient kingdom of Yr, later part of the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, in the first age of dragonkind. He was called Iras, and came from a poor fishing family.

It is said that he was out on the beach alone one day, when he had a vision: A great platinum dragon appeared before him from the depths of the ocean. It walked up to him out of the sea, and grasped his soul in one claw. He heard the words _"diisn hrav, ysan ta'i"_, walk the path, teach the way. His hair turned white, and a bright flame flared in his eye, before his sight went black. He returned from the beach a blind man with a mystical truesight, teaching what he called "the way".

The prophet had long ascended by now, but his teachings remain with the society of Parsor, to always be just, to always uphold order, and to follow the path lead by the White Prophet, to Xiron Shai.

### The Moon Gods, Lord of Rain; Syuanhai and Tsanghai

> _God of Rain! The full moon, the messenger of Irakon.  
The controller of water, the god of growth and harvest, the all-loving._
> 
> 雨神！月之明面，萬晶之使。  
> 治水者，春植與秋收之神，愛萬物之善者。

The two brothers were birthed when the old gods still walked the land, in the Age of Creation, and were the descent of god and mortal. Raised in the heart of Aseron, they grew to be unlike any other dragon, or any other mortal being, for that matter, being able to influence nature around them.

In the start the rains were made by Asyr Shai, and reflecting her nature they either came in devastating storms, or not at all, and under this the people suffered until the two brothers decided to take pity. They found that together they could control the rains, and for a while the mortals prospered. Asyr Shai noticed, eventually, and was angered at what they were doing, so she split them, making their power weaker. One is said to remain in Aseron, whilst the other lives in Qara Qai.

The Moon God is always depicted with a seven-star sword, a holy blade that can dispel all evil, and keep the terrors of the night at bay.

### The Sun God; Theianos

【中】日尊

> _The Eternal Sun! The daylight that purifies all things.  
> The god of life, piety and honesty, the brightness of summer._
> 
> 永恒太陽！淨化萬物之白晝。  
> 生命與純洁之神，暑夏之光。

Theianos was once a mortal prince of an ancient city, in modern-day Teucania. One day, he was sailing with his cousin, and when they were far out to sea, his cousin cast him into the waves, and left him to die. Alone on the great blue, Theianos drifted for forty days and forty nights, the sun beating down on him from above, the water clutching him from below, yet against all odds he did not die. Rather, he drifted far, until he finally washed up, on a beach near Makedonia.

Delirious and near-to-death, he saw an apparition standing above him, a sun standing on the earth, as the air around him burned, yet he was unharmed. The sun spoke to him with a voice that echoed through the heavens, commanding him to rise. As newfound energy washed through him, Theianos rose, and knelt at the sun's feet, at _Asyr's_ feet, and pledged the life she offered back to him, to serve as the Sun, and guide daylight through the material plane.

Sunlight reveals all, so his priests say, and more than the Sun, Theianos is the god of honesty and truth, his light revealing all lies.

His seat is atop Mount Helion in Dacrame. A holy temple of white marble sits there, letting followers of the sun make offerings to him.

### The Star God; An 

【中】星尊

> _The indomitable stars! Mother of omens, lord of myriad signs.    
> The leader of the seasons and changes, the guider of darkness and light, the Emperor of myriad stars._
> 
> 无上星尊！天兆之母，万象之主。    
> 牵四季五行者，导祥恶玄明者，万星之皇。

The God of Stars was the eldest of the lesser pantheon, so-called Asyr's greatest general. When Asyr herself was still the sun and the moon, watching over the ancient world, her most loyal servant, one of the first humans whom she named Emperor of Stars, commanded an army of "immortals". His most powerful lords: The House of the Azure Dragon in the east; the Black Warrior in the north; the White Tiger in the west; the Vermillion Bird in the south.

Before the time of Moira, the myriad stars watched the fortunes, and told the people of luck and misfortune, happiness and sorrow. The stars were to be feared; they were cold, unfeeling, and if you offended the God of Stars, he could write your death, and you would have no power to sway it.

When the stars died, his "immortals" fell into a deep slumber, moving across the night sky in innate formations, and such it was for countless thousand years. His descendants faded from the world, until one day one dragon called An Ye, of the central plains, descendant of a junior house of the Black Warrior, arrived to the eastern seas with a Daoist priest, together discovering this ancient lineage and finally being the first to claim this hallowed throne, becoming the youngest lesser god.

She holds a long polearm blade, glinting sinister silver, a blade that is said to be able to sever all karmic ties, and burn down entire lineages with a singe touch.
