# Aserian Elvish

## Introduction

<Drop>V</Drop>_en'na_ \[文話\] is the language of the elves of _Halvanai_, also known as the Tianyuan Continent (天元大陸). It is spoken by elvenkind in East Aseron in the material plane, as well as the equivalent regions of the twilight realm, east of the Kunnuu Mountains (崐峿山).

天元大陸靈族之言者，雖異於凡間，同承古字，與人類古篆、龍家金爪竝，因有所似所異。其假於人文，亦假於人音，故有讀者謂訓謂假。訓者本音，假者燕音，可見古二界所交交也矣。

### Phonology

Ven’na has a syllable structure of `(C)V(V)(C)`, with long vowels being treated as `VV`.

The vowels are:
- *a, aa, e, ee, i, ii, o, oo, u, uu, ae, oe, ie, ou, io*

The consonants are:
- *...*

***Emphasis.*** Emphasis is not strict, but usually placed on the last syllabel in a word-proper, before any particles. Long vowels take precedence and are always emphasised. When another syllable needs to be strictly emphasised, an áccent is used in romanisation.

***Readings.*** Having a common inheritance of Yan glyphs with Aseron on the material plane, most Yan-origin words and characters will have a borrowed loan reading and a native elvish reading. These are used side by side depending on situation.

***Pitch accent.*** Ven’na has pitch accent, with high and low
pitch. 
- Usually, the first syllable is lower pitched to the rest of the word. 
- Single syllable words are generally high pitch, except particles, and loan readings which are in the 去 or 入 tones. 

***Quiet vowels.*** Some (usually monosyllabic) words can begin with a "quiet vowel", denoted as an apostrophe before the first consonant, or as the vowel written in brackets. This is usually a short _i_ or _a_ and cannot be treated as a separate consonant. For example, [日] "sun" is read _'lan_ or _(i)lan_. 

Some words can also end in "quiet vowels", which are only enunciated when that word is spoken before a pause. This is usually a short _e_. For example, [吾] "I" is read *val'* or *val(e)*. This is not written unless such a quiet vowel should be said.

### Writing 

Ven'na words can be written either with Yan "borrowed characters" _chaavin_ [假文] or phonetically with "flowing script" _(a)laenvin_ [流文] or "cloud script" _yumvin_ [雲文]. 

_chaavin_ is used for writing Classical Chinese,
formal government documents, and the
philosophies. _'laenvin_ or mixed-script is used for all other uses.

In romanisation, square brackets are used to show the borrowed characters inline.

#### Topic-Comment

Ven’na is an SOV topic-comment agglutinative
language, that roughly tracks to Japanese.

`[1]` Ven'na is a pro-subject drop language.  

`[2]` Every phrase without particles is inherently a comment sentence with a null topic.

> [!comment]
> *man.* [this is a] tree.   
> `tree`

> [!comment]
> *halvanai.* [this is the] continent of Tianyuan.    
> `Tianyuan`

`[3]` There are two noun genders 
- *duun* (D) "earth" is the gender used for
physical things and places and standard way to refer
to oneself, people of lower ranks or friends
- *hála* (H) "heaven" is the gender used for
abstract concepts and polite way to refer to
equals and superiors.

`[4]` The **topic marker** *-sa* (D) and *-se* (H) indicates the previous noun phrase is the topic. This must agree with gender of the subject of the topic clause.

> [!comment]
> *(i)maesa faenyuunsha.* This is the Realm of Fengyuan     
> `here-TOPIC Fengyuan`

> [!comment]
> *valsa ali. alisa val(e).* I am an elf, an elf is me.    
> `me-TOPIC elf; elf-TOPIC me`

`[5]` *-na* (D) *-ne* (H) is a sentence final modal that turns a statement into a question.

> [!comment]
> *alse Lio Yan ne?* Are you Liu Yan?     
> `you-TOPIC.H Liu Yan QUESTION`

> [!comment]
> *ali na?* Are [they] an elf?     
> `elf QUESTION`

`[6]` ask an open ended question by replacing the queried part with *ina*. *ina* is a H noun.
- When in the comment position, it does not require *na/ne*

> [!comment]
> *inase ali ne?* What is an elf? [What do you call an elf]     
> `what-TOPIC.H elf QUESTION`

> [!comment]
> *alise ina?* What is an elf [discuss, 40 marks]    
> `elf-TOPIC.H what`

`[7]` *imas* means "where" and *imal* means "who". These are also H.

> [!comment] 
> *taise imal?* Who are they?    
> `they.sgl-TOPIC.H who`

> [!comment]
> *Lio Yanse imas?* Where's Liu Yan?    
> `Liu Yan-TOPIC.H where`

`[8]` The third person pronoun *tai* does not inherently encode for gender.

`[9]` *-mat* (D) *-mata* (H) is the sentence final modal that negates the comment.

> [!comment]
> *valsa ali mat. ilik.* I am not an elf. [I am a] human.    
> `me-TOPIC elf NOT; human`

> [!comment]
> *taisa savalka mat.* He is not a dragon.    
> `they.sgl-TOPIC dragon NOT`
