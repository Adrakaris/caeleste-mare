<Drop>D</Drop>raconic is the language of the dragons in the Material Plane, originating around the Spring of the Earth. It comes in two main dialects: eastern and western, *rékharhákr* and *rkaarik*, with limited intelligibility between them. There is also the ancient literary form of the language “*hakr*”, which is only preserved for highly formal and religious occasions, and is generally not known by outsiders.

*This is the fourth major iteration of draconic which contains breaking changes with previous versions and previous documents.*

## Sounds

Draconic did not originally have a native writing system of its own; in the east users generally wrote in logographic Yan seal script characters, whilst in the west it remained a spoken-only language until the first age of dragonkind, when a simple alphabet—abjad script was created in the Empire of Sun and Twisted Flax, formed of simple letters easily written or carved by claw. This later spread eastwards, and is in informal use both to write draconic and also to represent the sounds of the Yan languages.

Footnotes: 
- 【1】*h* and *kh* are pronounced the same, but the former is high pitch, and the latter is low pitch.
- 【2】In eastern draconic, this is only pronounced /f/ in *final* place, and /v/ everywhere else. Some accents do not separate the sounds. In western draconic, /f/ and /v/ are distinct but written the same.
- 【3】Usually /s/ with a low pitch, very rarely /θ/ and only then generally western dialects. Contrasts with *s* which is high pitch.
- 【4】Apostrophes indicate omitted letters and syllable demarcations where ambiguous

*Long vowels* are written using reduplicated vowel letters *aa, ee, ii, oo, uu*, however of these only *aa, ii* are common. This elongates the vowel sound but does not change its quality significantly. Vowel diphthongs include *ai* /aɪ/ and *ie* /ie/,

Draconic generally has a (CC)V(CC) structure, with ancient draconic having more of a (CCC)(V)(CCC) with some words (e.g. “*thr*”, water) having no (or rather very unstressed) vowels.

Also in ancient draconic, the merged sounds *h*, *kh*, *s*, and *th* are different in quality, being softer and harsher respectively, but this is generally difficult to hear, and modern readers will usually obey pitch accent rules.

### Spelling

Draconic spelling was never fossilised and is therefore very regular. All letters are pronounced except for final s. Romanisation reflects spelling, with the digraphs *th* and *kh* representing single letters. (The separate *t'h* and *k'h* are shown with apostrophes)

> [!comment]
> *othalon*. O Th A L O N.  \[<Drac>OTHALON</Drac>\]    
> *vathas*. V A Th A S.  \[<Drac>VATHAS</Drac>\]

*Stress* is always placed on long vowels if they exist. Otherwise, stress patterns are generally irregular, and accent marks can be used to indicate which syllables are stressed, which are useful in cases for disambiguation:

> [!comment]
> *as**ii**r*. Asyr Shai     
> ***á**siir*. the sun 


*Pitch accent* (explained later) is not shown, but is regular, and a result of merged sounds. 

All varieties of draconic exhibit “*s-dropping*”, where a grammatical final-s is replaced with a glottal stop. Final s however is always written.

> [!comment]
> *kains*. liked.     
> `LIKE-past`. /k<sup>h</sup>aɪnʔ/    

> [!comment]
> *váthas*. depths.     
> `DEPTHS`. /vasas/ or /vasa/ or /vasa:/

### Alphabet

The draconic alphabet is called the *akron*, after its first five letters. Each letter is given a name of a word beginning with it. Traditionally, only majuscule script existed, though minuscule "scribe-hand" developed in Dacrame, leading to [Rkaarik](#Rkaarik) using minuscule letters.

### Yan Characters

Speakers of eastern draconic exhibit an extreme case of diglossia, where draconic is spoken between speakers informally, but the literary Yan language (== *classical chinese*) is used for almost all formal documentation. Characters can also be used to write draconic, especially ancient draconic, in a mostly 1:1 semantic correspondence.

<h1 id="Rekharhakr" class="centre">Rekharhakr</h1>
<p class="subheading centre">High Draconic</p>

*High Draconic* or Eastern Draconic is the dialect of draconic spoken in Eastern Aseron and sparsely in the eastern reaches of Parsor. Draconic grammar and speech will be primarily described using this dialect, with differences highlighted for other dialects spoken.

## Pitch Accent  <span id="pitch-accent"></span>

Draconic has a pitch accent, due the general merger of the _h_,_kh_ and _s_,_th_ sounds. In general, syllables can have two accents: **high** (or flat) and **low**. These can also be marked by the Chinese characters 平 and 去.

_h_ and _s_ are **high** accent letters, and are read with the default high accent, contoured (33). However, due to final -s dropping a final -s does not affect the accent of a syllable.

_kh_ and _th_ are **low** accent, contoured (21) or (11).

All other syllables can be called **non-accented**, and have a high tone by default, but can be affected by the syllables around them. Some accents have different quality depending on the preceding syllable accent.

Note that since minimal accent pairs are relatively few, mis-accenting a word tends not to cause communication issues.

Full details of pitch transformations is shown below:

|Previous syllable|This syllable|Accent rules|Contours|
|---|---|---|---|
|High|High|-|A˧ B˧|
|Low|High|Accent previous as (11) even if it begins a word|A˩ B˦|
|None|High|-|A˧ B˧|
|High|Low|Pronounce this with higher falling contour (31)|A˧ B˧˩|
|Low|Low|Pronounce this with flat low contour (21) or (11)|A˨˩ B˩|
|None|Low|If previous is _stressed_, treat as high. If previous is _unstressed_, treat as low.|A˧ B˧˩ or A˩ B˨˩|
|High|None|-|A˧ B˧|
|Low|None|Pronounce this as low|A˧˩ B˩|
|None|None|(Optional) often pronounced as falling (32), can also be high.|A˧ B˧ or A˧ B˧˨|

## Grammar 

#### Word Order 
General word order is Subject-Verb-Object or Topic-Comment as in Chinese. Passive voice is very similar to topic-comment structure, but any subject is replaced with the copula BE verb. 

> [!comment]
> *aa triin thúrgar.* They eat fish    
> `THEY EAT FISH`


> [!comment]
> *thúrgar, aa triin.* Fish, they eat [it]    
> `FISH THEY EAT`


> [!comment]
> *thúrgar triin sn.* The fish is eaten    
> `FISH EAT BE-cop`

Rekharhakr is generally head-*initial*, and adjectives are placed after nouns. The formal order is: qualifier; proper adjective; colour; shape; age; size; quality. The same follows for adverbs as adverbs and adjectives are not differentiated.

> [!comment]
> *rekhár khrae.* Red dragon    
> `DRAGON RED`

However, in compound words — where two separate words are joined to make a new meaning — the main noun generally goes at the end.

> [!comment]
> *rekháridiks.* Dragonkind     
> `DRAGON-RACE`

#### Adjectives and Adverbs

There is no difference seen between adjectives and adverbs, other than that one goes after nouns and the other after verbs. Adjectives have no special word forms, and do not conjugate (apart from specific modifiers which are detailed in *Conjugation*). 

For the most part nouns can be used as adjectives to describe things that are like the noun, or of the noun. However, in some cases this may not make sense and the reverse is not true — adjectives generally cannot be used as nouns. Especially for literary reasons, "word unpacking", where a compound word is broken and the order put into head initial order is common.

> [!comment]
> *idíks rekhár.* dragonkind    
> `RACE DRAGON` (compound word unpacking)

#### Articles
There are no articles in rekharhakr draconic. Pluralisation is also implied. Number and quantity are generally placed before the noun, but can also be placed after as an adjective (this is rare).

> [!comment]
> *yir hákros.* a mountain    
> `ONE MOUNTAIN`

#### Pronouns 
Rekharhakr has the following pronouns for first and second person:

Pronoun | English
-|-
_zar_, _za_ | first person
_zii_ | second person (informal)
_záhar_ | second person (formal)

For third person pronouns, rekharhakr uses both gendered and non-gendered-generic pronouns, as well as a fourth pronoun for non-people (“lower-class”), much like the English “it”. However, this pronoun can be used for sentient beings such as other non-dragon races in an informal or disrespectful capacity.

Pronoun | English *(third person)*
-|-
 *aa* 	|generic singular pronoun 
 *aak* 	|male pronoun 
 *khaa* |female pronoun
 *thaa* |lower-class singular pronoun
 *saa* 	|generic plural pronoun
 *thiaa*|lower-class plural pronoun

#### Conjugation and Particles
Rekharhakr is very isolating with limited conjugation for tense and other modifiers, which generally do not change for case or person. 

Rekharhakr has a system of particles that can be pre- and appended to words to change their meaning or class.

The **possessive** particle *-on* is placed on the possessor with no modification to the word. The exception is for the first person pronoun *zar* and the second person informal pronoun *zii*, where *zaron* and *zii’on* is usually contracted to *ron* and *zin* respectively.

> [!comment]
> *khaaron draniir.* Her wisdom    
> `SHE-poss WISDOM`

Adding a possessive may shift syllable stress in certain cases, such as *xíron* “Xiron” becoming *xirónon* “of Xiron”.

The **attributor** particule *-is* is placed after a noun to signify the next phrase belongs to it in an abstract way, which is not a strict possession. It describes the location or context of an action or noun phrase. This is a very broad particle, and for concrete terms prepositions like *ith* or *zon* are preferred.

When this comes after *-i* (but `not` _-ai_) it lengthens the sound into _-iis_. When this comes after _-ii_ it becomes _-iris_.

The **actor** particle *-ak* is placed after a verb to subjectify it into an actor of that verb. It is similar to -er in English. The _-a-_ is never stressed and usually reduced to a schwa.

> [!comment]
> *xarái'is karínak.* The dancer in the night    
> `NIGHT-attr DANCE-actor`

The **group** particle *-ad* can be placed on a pronoun or a noun to show a group of something, similar to 们 in modern standard chinese. This is not used to show plurals and for standard nouns often appears only in subject place. Hence *zar* “I” can be made *zarad* “we (exclusive)”, *aak* “he” can be made *aakad* “they (masculine)”. This is not the case for *saa* and *thiaa* which are inherently plural.

> [!comment]
> *hir zarádon xirón.* These are our diamonds     
> `THIS I-group-poss DIAMOND`

Where the given word ends in a single *a*, the effect of adding a group elongates this into a double *aa*. If the word ends in a double *aa*, then only a *d* is suffixed. Hence *aa* “they (singl)” can be made *aad* “they (plur)”.


The **negation** particle *da* “not” can be put *before* a verb to negate it. This is often shortened to the prefix *d-*. Before certain consonants (and vowels), the *d-* prefix changes the quality of the consonant afterwards:

| original         | transformed | original | transformed |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
| *da* (not *daa*) | *dia*       | *dx*     | *zx*        |
| *dk*             | *dkh*       | *dm*     | *dv*        |
| *dn*             | *dan*       | *dl*     | *dr*        |
| *dd*             | *vd*        | *dp*     | *dv*        |
| *dt*             | *dz*        | *dg*     | *dig*       |

> [!comment]
> *za danadéns thaa.* I haven't seen it    
> `I not-SEE-past IT` (note ***dn**adéns* becomes ***dan**adéns*)

#### Verbs
All verbs have a root and an infinitive ending of *in*, except some irregular verbs (though some irregular verbs do end with *in*). Nouns ending in *in* should not be confused for verbs. 

Verbs conjugate to represent tense by changing the suffix, and generally do not conjugate based on person. The below shows conjugation for regular verbs. 

| Tense                        | Guide and Example                                                                                                                                 | ‘in      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Inf/Present                  | Present tense keeps the infinitive ending.<br/>*Aak paziin* / He plays                                                                             | *in*     |
| Past                         | Add an *s* on the end. This past is the generic ‘past tense’<br/>*Aak paxiins* / He played                                                         | *ins*    |
| Past imperfect /  pluperfect | Add *ir* on the end. This is generally used for pluperfect only.<br/>*Aak paziinir* / He had played                                                | *inir*   |
| Future                       | Replace *in* with *ix*.<br/>*Aak paziix* / He will play                                                                                            | *ix*     |
| Condl/past future            | Replace *in* with *ixa*.<br/>*Aak paziixa* / He would play                                                                                         | *ixa*    |
| Imperative                   | Replace *in* with *ii*. If the verb ends in *iin*, remove the *n*.<br/>*Pazii nal za* / Play with me. (informal) Remove in completely: Paz nal za. | *ii* / - |

*Note:* Some regular verbs on an irregular basis end with another vowel and *n* — these conjugate the same unless explicitly mentioned.

#### Modal Verbs 
Modal verbs, like “can”, “may”, etc. generally are single syllable words that do not conjugate. These include 
- *kat* — can / to be able to 
- *iir* — may / to be permitted to
- *os* — must / to be obligated to
- *has* — shall 
- *sis* — will / to be willing to (not used for generic future)

#### Irregular Verbs

Many verbs are irregular and have irregular conjugation. Some of these include *siin* (to be), *yaar* (to have), *komán* (to come), and *asrai'ín* (to fly).

Their full conjugations can be found in the [Dictionary](dictionary.html). *Pr. = Present; Ps. = Past; Pp. = Pluperfect; Fu. = Future; Co. = Conditional; Im. = Imperative*


#### The Copula
The copula “to be” is *siin* in the present tense, however the copula is almost never used in draconic, usually only for auxillary functions. To say that A is B, the two nouns are put next to each other. *siin* can also be used for affirmations in colloquial speech.

> [!comment]
> *aak rekhár.* He is a dragon 
> HE DRAGON

*siin* is also optional at the end of comments in topic-comment sentences as a comment marker, where it is usually in the reduced form as *sn* (pronounced /sən/), the only word to be written as two consonants.

> [!comment]
> *xanakhán golmák vaivére sn.* The deity Golmak is terrifying beyond comprehension     
> `DEITY GOLMAK TERRIFYING copula`

Finally, *siin* is used for the meaning "there exists", "there is", "we have" (similar to 有 in classical chinese). In this case the *-ii-* part is usually said lighter than usual.

#### Relative Pronouns
An example of a relative pronoun is the “who” in “he _who_ lights a fire”. Relative pronouns in rekharhakr can be constructed in two forms, either by repeating the pronoun in question, or by using a topic comment sentence with mandatory comment marker. 

> [!comment]
> *aak, aak anavín yíra.* He who lights a fire    
> `HE, HE LIGHT FIRE`

> [!comment]
> *aak anavín yíra sn.* He who lights a fire   
> `HE LIGHT FIRE copula`

#### Honorifics 
Proper nouns are given no significance in writing, however an underline on the bottom (horizontal text) or right (vertical text) side can be used to indicate names. Honorifics are placed after a person’s name:

> [!comment]
> *siin ástron arkhán, maa taikhán, lurkhái khan.* There is Lord Astron, Duke Ma, and King Lurkhai
> `BE ASTRON LORD, MA DUKE, LURKHAI KING`

*Rkaarik* is the western dialect of draconic, spoken in Dacrame and most of western and southern Parsor. It is generally similar to eastern draconic, with some changes in vocabulary and more verb forms, as well as some more differentiated sounds. This section will detail differences with *rekharhakr*.

Certain words carry influences from Rivenian, Elyrian and other western languages. 

## Sound Changes

*Rkaarik* has a new sound: *xh* /ʃ/, which is represented by the digraph `XH` [<Drac>XH</Drac>]. The sounds /f/ and /v/ *are* different in speech, although still written by the same letter.

*Rkaarik* generally lacks a pitch accent, instead the two merged pairs *h, kh* and *s, th* are somewhat differentiated.
- *h* is a slightly gentler growl than *kh*, although the two are starting to merge, resulting in some tonogenesis in native speakers (dragons) and a pure merger in literary users (non-dragons who require knowledge for history, administration, or other reasons)
- *s* is a slightly sharper hiss than *th*, although literary users are starting to use thorn /θ/ to pronounce the letter *th*.

Literary users will also tend to pronounce final-s sounds

### Alphabet 
Note that _rkaarik_ uses **minuscule script**, especially in scribal records in western states like Rivian. The west also tends to use a greater range of puncuation, whilst _rekharhakr_ traditions following Yan tend to not, or at most use the period (<Drac>.</Drac>)

There are several writing styles and there are no set conventions, however the general standard goes:
- majuscule is _not_ used for the start of sentences. It _may_ be used (often as a drop-capital) at the start of chapters or sections of text.
- all nouns and proper nouns (but _not_ pronouns) are capitalised.
- names of deities, mythical figures, or nations (e.g. Asyr, Rivian and Ricarin, Helion) may be written in all-capitals for respect. 
- there is no difference for title case, however title case _can_ be all-capital.

## Grammar

#### Word order and Articles

*Rkaarik* is **head-final**: adjectives and adverbs come *before* the noun or verb in question. Head-initial form is still valid in literary contexts. Topic-comment sentences constructed the same.

Articles similarly do not exist, but are slowly appearing in speech, as prefix *t’* for the definite article and *k’* for the indefinite article become more prevalent and inconsistent consonant shifts due to it appear within sublects. These are however not written down.

#### Conjugation and Tenses

The actor particles *-as, -ak, -ask* are all valid in place of *-ak* in *rekharhakr*.

Verbs generally end in *-in, -en,* and *-an*, and irregular verbs also exist to a lesser extent. Generally, if a verb is irregular in *rkaarik*, it is irregular in *rekharhakr*, but some irregular verbs in *rekharhakr* has been regularised.

| Tense                | ‘*in*  | ‘*en*  | ‘*an*  |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Inf/Present          | *in*   | *en*   | *an*   |
| Past imperfect       | *ins*  | *ens*  | *ans*  |
| Past perf/pluperfect | *inir* | *enir* | *i*    |
| Future               | *ix*   | *enk*  | *ah*   |
| Condl/past future    | *ixa*  | *enix* | *anix* |
| Imperative           | *ii*   | *er*   | *ai*   |

#### Irregular Verbs

Many, but fewer verbs in Rkaarik are also irregular. Some irregular verbs have been regularised into the other two verb endings.

<p class="subheading centre">Ancient / Classical Draconic</p>

## History and Writing

The ancient spoken form of draconic as it was during and before the first Age of Dragonkind. It had no writing system, as the dragon clans saw no need for writing.

Later, as ideas of state and kingdom permeated through the clans, along with the realisation that rule, taxation, and trade monopoly may be an easier way of amassing wealth than plunder, many of them coalesced into small nations, often deep within the mountains, ruling over other races. These nations generally took on the writing system of whatever culture group they merged into, with the Kingdom of Yan adopting a form of central plains seal script, and the clans of Parsor using the primitive Parsii alphabet.

The latter evolved into an alphabet (read: abjad) specifically for draconic, and as it was first written, only consonants, long vowels, and initial strong vowels were represented. All others were left to be inferred, and in some cases were so weak that modern classical draconic still lacks any definite vowel. 

When writing in this way, vowel digraphs are represented using other letters:

| Modern digraph | Ancient letter(s) |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| *ai*           | F (V) <Drac>F</Drac>|
| *ae*           | Y  <Drac>Y</Drac> |
| *ie*           | Y  <Drac>Y</Drac> |
| *ua*           | R  <Drac>R</Drac> |
| *i’a*          | I A   <Drac>IA</Drac>  |

*note:* only the first two are proper vowel diphthongs, all other vowel pairs are generally pronounced separately and not as one sound.

> *khro sar salk'ns zo dir.* A time when heaven separated from earth.    
> `KhR SR SLKNS Z DR` [<Drac>KHR SR SLKNS Z DR</Drac>]

However, modern writers of classical draconic using the draconic alphabetical script generally write it according to modern convention (only omitting the weak vowels) 

## Grammar and Sounds

Classical Draconic has the concept of “weak vowels”, which are written in romanisation in brackets — *(a)srain* (to fly) — weak vowels are **never** stressed and often not pronounced altogether, or barely enunciated. Weak vowels are not written even in modern alphabetical writing form.

Many words which have split or gained vowels in modern forms of draconic lack them in classical draconic, leading to a more terse language, but one with significantly more “difficult” consonant clusters. 

Other words have branched into multiple modern words to disambiguate meaning.

Ancient grammar generally tracks that of eastern draconic, but word functions are much less clear. There are no explicit verbs — rather the verb ending is *-n*, which can generally be added to the end of any noun to “verb” it. The past tense verb ending is *-s* which comes after *-n*, and there is no explicit future or conditional marker, leading to time being required to differentiate. 

*Classical Draconic also closely tracks the grammar and writing style of Classical Chinese, being especially terse in nature.*
