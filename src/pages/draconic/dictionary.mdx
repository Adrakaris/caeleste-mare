A "ditto mark" ( " ) in an entry indicates it is identical to the one left of it. "nf." indicates not finished. Irregular verbs have conjugations shown; if a conjugation is missing from _rkaarik_, that indicates it is the same as its _rekharhakr_ counterpart. Word categories are just a rough guide and many nouns especially can be used as adjectives.

A bold **I** indicates an irregular verb. Click on the **I** to show its irregular conjugations.

Words separated by spaces in the query do not need to be consecutive in the dictionary.

Search in specific columns by using the buttons provided or by pressing Ctrl + Alt + the number on the button (⌃ ⌥ Number). Press Esc to cancel search and show all.
