## Introduction

<Drop>T</Drop>he twilight vale is the home realm of
the Elves, a land bathed in eternal
twilight. In the west, it is known as the
Twilight Vale or Realm, whilst in the
east, it is known as the ling-chien 靈間, “elven
plane”. The elves themselves call it alavaan,
with a similar meaning to the above.
It’s mountains and seas mirror that of the
material world, but its skies and forests could
be no further different. A land formed before
any written histories, from ancient calamities
humans, by the patron God of the Elves,
Valaan, it sits as a strange mirror, linked
through mysterious forces.

Sometimes, where elves build their great cities
in the Twilight, the people of the Material may
find strange ruins in their corresponding place.
Similarly, great cities and ancient magical sites
in the Material show their effects in the Twilight.
Unlike the settled lands of the Material Plane,
the Twilight is a wild and dangerous place, full
of wild beasts, magical flora, and mysterious
and unknown races. In the material, danger
lurks at the corners of civilisation; in the
twilight, pockets of civilisation shine across a
dark and untamed land.
